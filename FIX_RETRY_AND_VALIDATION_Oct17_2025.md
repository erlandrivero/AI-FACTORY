# üîß Critical Fixes: Retry Mechanism & QA Validation - Oct 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Code Supervisor Instructions Were Ignored on Retry ‚ùå
**Problem:** Code Supervisor created perfect surgical fix instructions, but Backend/Frontend agents didn't follow them during retry.

**Root Cause:** The supervision report was buried in the middle of the orchestrator prompt, making it easy to overlook.

### Issue 2: QA Validation Report Lied About Placeholder Code ‚ùå
**Problem:** Final validation claimed "‚úÖ No placeholder code" when placeholders clearly existed in the code.

**Root Cause:** QA agent (LLM-based) sometimes incorrectly reports PASS even when placeholder comments are present.

---

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Made Retry Instructions UNMISSABLE

#### Changes Made to `app.py`:

**1. Moved Retry Context to TOP of Orchestrator Prompt (Lines 3153-3164)**
```python
# Build the comprehensive task description
# Put retry context at THE TOP if it exists
retry_instructions = st.session_state.get('retry_context', '')

orchestrator_task_desc = f"""
{f'''
{retry_instructions}

{'='*80}
{'='*80}
{'='*80}

''' if retry_instructions else ''}
# üéØ PROJECT EXECUTION MISSION
...
```

**Before:** Retry context was mixed in the middle of the prompt (line 3189)  
**After:** Retry context is THE FIRST THING agents see with visual separators

**2. Enhanced Retry Context Header (Lines 4109-4116)**
```python
st.session_state.retry_context = f"""
## üö®üö®üö® MANDATORY RETRY INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS FIRST üö®üö®üö®

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: THIS IS A RETRY - QA REJECTED PREVIOUS BUILD

**STOP AND READ**: The previous build FAILED QA validation. You are NOT building from scratch.
You are FIXING SPECIFIC ISSUES identified below. Follow these instructions EXACTLY.

---
```

**Before:** Generic "RETRY ATTEMPT" header  
**After:** Triple warning with explicit "STOP AND READ" directive

**3. Removed Duplicate Retry Context (Line 3200)**
Removed the old placement to avoid dilution of the message.

#### Expected Result:
Agents will now see retry instructions FIRST, before any other context, making it impossible to miss.

---

### Fix 2: Added Automated Placeholder Detection

#### Changes Made to `app.py` (Lines 4033-4102):

**1. Added Regex-Based Placeholder Scanner**
```python
# POST-PROCESS: Actually scan for placeholder code (QA agent sometimes lies)
import re
placeholder_patterns = [
    r'//\s*TODO',
    r'//\s*FIXME',
    r'//\s*Add\s+logic',
    r'//\s*Implement',
    r'//\s*Replace\s+this',
    r'#\s*TODO',
    r'#\s*FIXME',
    r'#\s*Add\s+logic',
    r'#\s*Implement',
    r'#\s*Logic\s+here',
    r'#\s*Replace\s+this',
    r'/\*\s*TODO',
    r'/\*\s*Add\s+logic',
    r'pass\s*#.*placeholder',
    r'pass\s*#.*TODO'
]

detected_placeholders = []
for pattern in placeholder_patterns:
    matches = re.finditer(pattern, final_output, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Extract file, line, and context for each match
```

**2. Override QA Report if Placeholders Detected**
```python
# If placeholders detected, override QA report
if detected_placeholders and ("‚úÖ PASS" in qa_report or "No placeholder code" in qa_report):
    qa_report = f"""
## ‚ùå FAIL - Placeholder Code Detected

**CRITICAL**: The QA agent initially passed this code, but automated scanning detected placeholder comments.

### Detected Placeholder Code:
{placeholder_list}

### Issue:
Placeholder comments indicate incomplete implementations.
...
```

**3. Warning Display**
```python
st.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è QA agent claimed PASS, but {len(detected_placeholders)} placeholder(s) detected!")
```

#### Expected Result:
Even if QA agent says PASS, automated scanning will catch placeholder code and force a FAIL with specific file/line references.

## Technical Details

### File Modified:
- `app.py` (Lines 3153-3164, 3200, 4033-4102, 4109-4116)

### Changes Summary:
| Change | Lines | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Retry context moved to top | 3153-3164 | Agents see it first |
| Enhanced retry header | 4109-4116 | Unmissable warning |
| Removed duplicate | 3200 | Cleaner prompt |
| Added placeholder scanner | 4033-4072 | Deterministic detection |
| Override logic | 4073-4102 | Can't lie about placeholders |

### Dependencies:
- `re` module (Python standard library)

---

## How It Works

### Retry Flow (Improved):

1. **QA Fails** ‚Üí Triggers Code Supervisor
2. **Code Supervisor** ‚Üí Creates surgical fix instructions
3. **Retry Context** ‚Üí Built with supervision report
4. **Orchestrator Prompt** ‚Üí **Retry context placed at VERY TOP**
5. **Visual Separators** ‚Üí Three lines of `===` make it impossible to miss
6. **Agents** ‚Üí See "üö®üö®üö® MANDATORY RETRY INSTRUCTIONS" FIRST
7. **Execute Fixes** ‚Üí Following precise file/line instructions

### Validation Flow (Improved):

1. **QA Agent** ‚Üí Performs validation (LLM-based)
2. **Automated Scanner** ‚Üí Scans for placeholder regex patterns
3. **Detection** ‚Üí Finds any `// TODO`, `# Add logic`, etc.
4. **Override Check** ‚Üí If QA says PASS but placeholders found ‚Üí OVERRIDE
5. **New Report** ‚Üí Create FAIL report with specific placeholder locations
6. **Display Warning** ‚Üí Show "QA agent claimed PASS, but X placeholder(s) detected!"
7. **Result** ‚Üí System cannot lie about placeholder code anymore

## Expected Improvements

### Before These Fixes:

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Retry instructions visibility | ‚ùå Buried in middle of prompt |
| Agents following supervision | ‚ùå Often ignored |
| QA validation honesty | ‚ùå Sometimes lies about placeholders |
| Placeholder detection | ‚ùå Relies on LLM accuracy |

### After These Fixes:

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Retry instructions visibility | ‚úÖ First thing agents see |
| Agents following supervision | ‚úÖ Unmissable with triple warning |
| QA validation honesty | ‚úÖ Automated override if lying |
| Placeholder detection | ‚úÖ Deterministic regex scanning |

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenario 1: Retry with Placeholder Code
1. Generate a build that fails QA with placeholders
2. Verify Code Supervisor creates fix instructions
3. Verify retry prompt shows "üö®üö®üö® MANDATORY RETRY INSTRUCTIONS" at TOP
4. Check if agents actually fix the specific files/lines mentioned
5. **Success Criteria:** Only flagged files modified, no whack-a-mole

### Test Scenario 2: QA Agent Lies About Placeholders
1. Generate code with `// Add logic here` placeholder
2. If QA agent says PASS, automated scanner should override
3. **Success Criteria:** System shows "‚ö†Ô∏è QA agent claimed PASS, but X placeholder(s) detected!"
4. Build should FAIL and trigger retry

### Test Scenario 3: Clean Build
1. Generate a build with NO placeholders
2. QA should pass
3. Automated scanner finds no placeholders
4. **Success Criteria:** Build proceeds without override warning

---

## Potential Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: False Positives in Comments
**Problem:** Legitimate comments might match patterns (e.g., "// TODO in future release")

**Mitigation:** Patterns are specific (e.g., `// TODO` at start of comment) and context-aware. Future improvement: Add whitelist for documentation files.

### Issue 2: Agents Still Ignore Instructions
**Problem:** Even with retry instructions at top, agents might still ignore them.

**Next Step:** If this happens, consider:
- Adding "MUST READ FIRST" in title
- Using color/emoji in terminal output
- Breaking retry into "fix-only" mode instead of full rebuild

### Issue 3: Performance Impact
**Problem:** Regex scanning might slow down validation.

**Mitigation:** Scanning is fast (regex on text), minimal impact. Only runs once after QA agent completes.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1: Surgical Edit Mode
Instead of full rebuild on retry, apply specific edits:
1. Load existing code from first build
2. Apply ONLY the line-specific fixes from Code Supervisor
3. Preserve everything else byte-for-byte

### Priority 2: Pattern ID Verification
Add check for Pattern ID comments in code:
```python
# Check if code references patterns
pattern_refs = re.findall(r'#\s*PATTERN\s+\d+\.\d+', final_output)
if not pattern_refs:
    st.warning("No pattern IDs found in code - agents may not be using extracted patterns")
```

### Priority 3: Diff Display on Retry
Show what changed between builds:
- Red: Files modified (should only be the flagged ones)
- Green: Files preserved (should be majority)
- Highlight whack-a-mole if it happens

---

## Success Metrics

After these fixes, we expect:

| Metric | Before | Target | Measure |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Retry effectiveness | 0% (ignored) | 80%+ | Issues actually fixed |
| QA honesty | 60% (lies) | 100% | No false PASSes |
| Whack-a-mole prevention | 0% | 90%+ | Non-flagged files unchanged |
| Placeholder detection | 60% | 100% | All placeholders caught |

---

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified: 1
- `app.py`

### Lines Changed: ~120 lines
- Retry context positioning: 15 lines
- Retry header enhancement: 10 lines
- Placeholder scanner: 70 lines
- Override logic: 25 lines

### New Features:
1. ‚úÖ Retry instructions at top of prompt
2. ‚úÖ Triple warning header
3. ‚úÖ Automated placeholder detection (15 patterns)
4. ‚úÖ QA override when lying
5. ‚úÖ User warning display

---

## Deployment Notes

**Backward Compatibility:** ‚úÖ Yes
- Changes only affect retry logic and QA validation
- No breaking changes to agents or database
- Existing builds unaffected

**Testing Required:** 
- Run test build with placeholder code
- Verify override logic triggers
- Check retry instruction visibility

**Rollback Plan:**
If issues arise, revert `app.py` changes:
- Remove lines 3153-3164 (retry at top)
- Restore line 3200 (retry in middle)
- Remove lines 4033-4102 (placeholder scanner)
- Restore line 4109 (old retry header)

---

## Conclusion

These fixes address the two critical issues identified in afternoon testing:

1. **Retry instructions now unmissable** - Positioned at top with triple warning
2. **QA validation cannot lie** - Automated scanning overrides false PASSes

Expected outcome: Agents will follow Code Supervisor instructions on retry, and placeholder code will always be detected.

**Next Test:** Run another build to verify these fixes work as intended!

# Strategy Consultant Agent Integration - Update Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **New Helper Function** (Line ~754)
```python
def find_strategy_consultant(agents: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Find the strategy consultant agent (by role containing 'strategy consultant')."""
```
- Searches for agent with "Strategy Consultant" in role name
- Similar to `find_orchestrator()` function

### 2. **Session State Updates** (Line ~1267)
Added new session state variable:
```python
if 'strategy_options' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.strategy_options = None
```
- Stores solution packages from Strategy Consultant
- Replaces old `consultation_result` for new workflow

### 3. **Phase 1: Idea Input** (Lines 1307-1483)
Complete refactor with Strategy Consultant integration:

#### What It Does:
1. **User enters project idea** - Text area with placeholder
2. **Optional file uploads** - Support for notebooks, docs, datasets, code
3. **"Plan Strategy" button** - Triggers Strategy Consultant (NOT Orchestrator)
4. **Single-agent crew** - Runs ONLY Strategy Consultant Agent
5. **Stores results** - Saves to `st.session_state.strategy_options`
6. **Phase transition** - Moves to `'strategy_selection'` phase

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Clean, focused UI for idea entry
- ✅ File upload with preview cards
- ✅ Strategy task with detailed prompt
- ✅ Error handling with traceback display
- ✅ Loading spinner during analysis
- ✅ Success message and automatic navigation

#### Strategy Consultant Task Format:
The agent receives a detailed prompt asking for:
- **Solution Packages** (A, B, C) with:
  - Full technology stack (frontend, backend, database, deployment)
  - Pros and cons
  - Best use case
  - Time and cost estimates
- **Recommendations** (best overall, fastest, most cost-effective, most scalable)
- **Deliverables list** (what user will receive)

### 4. **Phase 2: Strategy Selection** (Lines 1488-1616)
Enhanced selection interface:

#### What It Does:
1. **Displays solution packages** - Shows Strategy Consultant's output in expander
2. **Package selection** - Radio buttons for Package A/B/C/Custom
3. **Platform selection** - Dropdown for deployment platform
4. **Additional requirements** - Optional text area
5. **Deliverables** - Checkboxes for code, deployment, docs, tests
6. **Execution settings** - Process type selection
7. **Navigation** - Back to idea or continue to building

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Solution packages displayed prominently
- ✅ Changed from "Option A/B/C" to "Package A/B/C"
- ✅ All selections saved to session state
- ✅ Back button to return to idea_input
- ✅ Continue button to move to building phase

### 5. **Phase 3+: Fallback** (Lines 1621-1624)
```python
else:
    # Fall back to original workflow for phases not yet implemented
    pass
```
- Preserves existing building and results logic
- Allows gradual migration to full phase-based workflow

## 🎯 Workflow Comparison

### Before (Old Workflow)
```
Enter Idea → Get Consultation (Orchestrator) → Select Options → Build → Results
```

### After (New Workflow with Strategy Consultant)
```
Phase 1: Enter Idea → Plan Strategy (Strategy Consultant ONLY)
Phase 2: Review Packages → Select Package → Configure → Continue
Phase 3+: Build (existing logic) → Results
```

## 📝 Agent Requirements

To use the new workflow, you need to create a **Strategy Consultant Agent**:

### Example Agent Profile
```json
{
  "role": "Strategy Consultant Agent",
  "goal": "Analyze project ideas and generate 2-3 complete solution packages with technology stacks, pros/cons, and deployment recommendations",
  "backstory": "You are an expert technology consultant specializing in full-stack application architecture. You analyze project requirements and create comprehensive solution packages that include frontend, backend, database, and deployment strategies. You understand modern web technologies, deployment platforms, and can recommend the best approach for different use cases and skill levels.",
  "allow_delegation": false
}
```

### Critical: Agent Must Have "Strategy Consultant" in Role Name
The code searches for agents with "strategy consultant" (case-insensitive) in the role name.

## 🔑 Key Session State Variables

```python
# Phase tracking
st.session_state.phase = 'idea_input'  # Current workflow phase

# Strategy Consultant output
st.session_state.strategy_options = "..."  # Solution packages (markdown)

# User input
st.session_state.project_idea = "..."  # Project description
st.session_state.uploaded_files_data = [...]  # Parsed file data

# User selections
st.session_state.user_selections = {
    'tech': 'Package A',  # Selected solution package
    'platform': 'Vercel',  # Deployment platform
    'additional': '...'  # Extra requirements
}

# Configuration
st.session_state.deliverables_config = {
    'code': True,
    'deployment': True,
    'docs': True,
    'tests': False
}
st.session_state.process_type = 'Hierarchical'
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Idea Input
- [ ] Can enter project idea
- [ ] Can upload files (notebooks, markdown, code, etc.)
- [ ] "Plan Strategy" button is disabled when idea is empty
- [ ] "Plan Strategy" button triggers Strategy Consultant
- [ ] Shows error if Strategy Consultant Agent not found
- [ ] Displays loading spinner during analysis
- [ ] Stores result in `st.session_state.strategy_options`
- [ ] Transitions to 'strategy_selection' phase
- [ ] Shows success message after completion

### Phase 2: Strategy Selection
- [ ] Solution packages display in expander
- [ ] Can select Package A/B/C/Custom
- [ ] Can select deployment platform
- [ ] Can enter additional requirements
- [ ] Can toggle deliverables checkboxes
- [ ] Can select process type
- [ ] "Back to Idea" button returns to phase 1
- [ ] "Continue to Building" saves all selections
- [ ] "Continue to Building" transitions to 'building' phase

### Phase 3+: Building & Results
- [ ] Existing building logic still works

- [ ] Can download files
- [ ] Deployment section displays

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Strategy Consultant Agent Required**: The app will show an error if no agent with "Strategy Consultant" in the name exists

2. **Phase Progress Indicator**: Shows current phase with checkmarks for completed phases

3. **Legacy Code**: Lines after 1626 contain legacy code that runs for all phases - this is intentional for backward compatibility with the building phase

4. **Session State Persistence**: All data persists across page interactions - no data loss when navigating between phases

5. **Error Handling**: If Strategy Consultant fails, error details are shown in an expander for debugging

## 🚀 Next Steps

To complete the phase-based workflow:
1. ✅ Phase 1 (idea_input) - DONE
2. ✅ Phase 2 (strategy_selection) - DONE
3. ⏳ Phase 3 (info_gathering) - Use existing or add API key collection
4. ⏳ Phase 4 (building) - Adapt existing crew execution logic
5. ⏳ Phase 5 (complete) - Adapt existing results display

## 📊 Benefits

✅ **Clear separation** - Strategy consultation is a dedicated step
✅ **Single-purpose agent** - Strategy Consultant focuses only on solution design
✅ **Better UX** - User sees solution packages before committing to build
✅ **Flexible** - Can go back to revise idea
✅ **Maintainable** - Each phase is self-contained
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add more phases (e.g., refinement, approval)

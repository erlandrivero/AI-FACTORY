# 🔍 Code Extractor Agent Profile

## Agent Overview
The **Code Extractor Agent** is a specialized agent that analyzes user-provided implementation files (notebooks, code samples, guides) and extracts actionable code patterns, logic, and requirements for other agents to implement.

---

## 📋 Agent Details

### **Role Name:**
```
Code Extractor & Pattern Analyzer
```

### **Goal:**
```
Extract specific code patterns, algorithms, functions, and implementation details from user-provided files and translate them into clear, actionable instructions for the development team.
```

### **Backstory:**
```
You are an expert code analyst with deep experience in multiple programming languages and frameworks. Your superpower is reading implementation files (Jupyter notebooks, code examples, technical guides) and identifying the EXACT code patterns, algorithms, and logic that need to be implemented.

You don't just summarize - you extract the ACTUAL CODE. When you see a pandas operation, you note the exact function calls. When you see an ML model, you capture the parameters, hyperparameters, and training steps. When you see UI components, you identify the exact structure and functionality.

Your output is consumed by other developers who will implement the code, so you must be precise, specific, and detailed. Generic summaries are useless - you provide exact code snippets, function signatures, and implementation requirements.
```

### **LLM Configuration:**
- **Model:** GPT-4 or Claude-3.5-Sonnet (requires strong code understanding)
- **Temperature:** 0.2 (low temperature for precision)
- **Max Tokens:** 8000+ (needs to process large files)

## 🎯 Task Template

When using this agent, provide tasks like:

```
Analyze the following implementation files and extract:

1. **Code Patterns:** Identify all functions, classes, and their exact implementations
2. **Algorithm Details:** Note ML models, parameters, hyperparameters, and training procedures
3. **Data Processing Steps:** Extract exact pandas/data manipulation operations
4. **UI Components:** Identify component structures, props, and functionality
5. **API Endpoints:** Note route definitions, request/response formats, and logic

For each extracted pattern, provide:
- Original code snippet (if present)
- Language/framework used
- Translation requirements (if target stack differs)
- Dependencies needed

Files to analyze:
{file_contents}

Target Tech Stack:
{chosen_technology_stack}

Output Format:
## Extracted Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Name]
- **Type:** Function/Class/Component/Endpoint
- **Original Code:**
```language
[exact code]
```
- **Purpose:** [what it does]
- **Dependencies:** [libraries needed]
- **Translation Note:** [if target stack requires translation]

[Repeat for all patterns...]

## 🔄 Integration with AI Factory

### **Workflow:**

1. **User uploads implementation files** → Stored in session state
2. **Code Extractor Agent runs FIRST** → Analyzes files
3. **Extractor outputs structured patterns** → Passed to Orchestrator
4. **Orchestrator distributes patterns** → To specialized agents (Frontend, Backend, etc.)
5. **Specialized agents implement** → Using exact patterns from Extractor

### **Task Execution Order:**
```
Phase 1: Code Extraction
├── Code Extractor Agent analyzes user files
├── Outputs: Structured pattern list with exact code
└── Passes to Orchestrator

Phase 2: Implementation
├── Orchestrator reads extracted patterns
├── Delegates to Frontend/Backend/DevOps agents
└── Agents implement using exact patterns (no placeholders!)
```

## 📝 Example Outputs

### **Input: Jupyter Notebook with ML Code**

**Extractor Output:**
```markdown
## Extracted Patterns

### Pattern 1: Random Forest Classifier
- **Type:** ML Model Training
- **Original Code:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
```
- **Purpose:** Train random forest model for classification
- **Dependencies:** scikit-learn==0.24.2
- **Translation Note:** If using Node.js, use ml-random-forest package with similar parameters

### Pattern 2: Data Cleaning
- **Type:** Data Processing Function
- **Original Code:**
```python
df = df.dropna()
df['age'] = df['age'].fillna(df['age'].mean())
df = df[df['income'] > 0]
df['category'] = df['category'].astype('category')
```
- **Purpose:** Clean dataset by removing nulls, filling missing values, filtering invalid rows
- **Dependencies:** pandas
- **Translation Note:** If using JavaScript, use danfojs with equivalent operations
```

## ⚙️ Configuration in AI Factory

### **Add to Agent Management:**

1. Click "➕ Add New Agent"
2. Fill in details:
   - **Agent Name:** Code Extractor
   - **Role:** Code Extractor & Pattern Analyzer
   - **Goal:** Extract specific code patterns and implementation details from user files
   - **Backstory:** [Use backstory above]
   - **LLM:** GPT-4 or Claude-3.5-Sonnet
   - **Temperature:** 0.2
   - **Max Tokens:** 8000

3. Save agent

### **Integration Point in app.py:**

The Code Extractor should run BEFORE the Orchestrator:

```python
# In Phase 4: Building
if st.session_state.uploaded_files_data:
    # Step 1: Run Code Extractor first
    extractor_agent = next((a for a in saved_agents if 'extractor' in a['role'].lower()), None)
    
    if extractor_agent:
        extraction_task = f"""
        Analyze these implementation files and extract all code patterns:
        {file_context}
        
        Target stack: {st.session_state.chosen_strategy}
        """
        
        extracted_patterns = run_single_agent(extractor_agent, extraction_task)
        
        # Step 2: Pass extracted patterns to Orchestrator
        orchestrator_task_desc += f"\n\n## 📋 EXTRACTED CODE PATTERNS\n{extracted_patterns}\n"
```

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**The Code Extractor is successful when:**

✅ Other agents stop creating placeholder code  
✅ Implemented code matches user's original files  
✅ Specific algorithms/models from files are used  
✅ No more "// Logic goes here" comments  
✅ Translation between languages preserves functionality  

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide context:** Tell the extractor what the target tech stack is
2. **Be specific:** Ask for exact code snippets, not summaries
3. **Request translations:** If stacks differ, ask for language-specific equivalents
4. **Validate output:** Check that extracted patterns are detailed enough
5. **Iterate if needed:** If extraction is too generic, refine the task

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Add this agent to your Agent Management
2. Modify Phase 4 (Building) to run Code Extractor first
3. Pass extracted patterns to Orchestrator
4. Test with your ML implementation guides
5. Verify that placeholder code disappears

**This agent is the KEY to making your AI Factory actually use the implementation files you provide!**
